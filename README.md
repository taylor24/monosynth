# Learn Chords

This is a 3x Oscillator synthesizer.

Check it out, feel free to fork, submit pull requests, etc.

As of June 2014, the only browser supporting this is Chrome, and you must turn on the #enable-web-midi flag in chrome://flags.  It should then work across OSX, Windows, Linux and Android, provided you have appropriate hardware.
